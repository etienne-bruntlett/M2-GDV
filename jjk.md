**Peggle** but **Jujutsu Kaisen**

# Main Gameplay
The main gameplay consists of the basic Peggle gameplay, though instead of shooting metal balls you shoot what is known as a Hollow Purple.

In this version of Peggle, instead of shooting pins and getting points from them, the goal is to defeat all the curses (*enemies*) on the field. There will be a few levels, increasing in difficulty, until finally finishing off with the final level, a bossfight against the King of Curses, **Ryomen Sukuna**.

# New Features
This new Peggle game adds a few new mechanics on to the original game, the main one being:
**Cursed Techniques**
[gojogetochoso]
These new special techniques can be aquired by beating certain levels, and using the techniques requires a certain amount of score in order to use. These techniques consist of:

- Boogie Woogie
- Rabbit Escape
- Piercing Blood
- Hairpin
- Resonance
- Cursed Speech: Fall
- Cursed Speech: Explode
- Supernova
- Black Flash

The amount of Cursed Techniques might increase or decrease in the future, but for now, these are the special abilities.
